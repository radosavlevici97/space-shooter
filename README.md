# Space Shooter

Welcome to the Space Shooter open source game! This project was created to practice my skills, using the PixiJS library. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide and example of my game development skills in PixiJS.

This project utilises multiple pixi based libraries including;

- [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs) a rendering library built for the web.
- [AssetPack](https://github.com/pixijs/assetpack) that optimises assets for the web!
- [Demo](https://main.d1fe7hiiegfan5.amplifyapp.com/)

# Features

- Simple, example of a PixiJS game,
- Clear and concise code explanations,
- Includes essential game development concepts such as systems, game loops, and user input etc.
- Designed to be easily understandable and expandable for further learning and development

# Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your system.

# Setup and run the game

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/radosavlevici97/space-shooter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the project
npm run start
```

# Building the game

```sh
# Compile the game into a bundle, which can be found in `dist/`
npm run build`
```

# Known issues

- Asset bundles aren't currently watched, so any assets being added or removed would mean you have to run `npm run build-assets` again
- It may take a while for vite to launch the game on localhost
- Resize functionality is not fully implemented, so is not working yet
- Game finish scenario is not implemented yet.

# Usage

Feel free to use this project as a reference for your own game development. Use the code comments to understand how the game works and experiment by making changes to the code to see how it affects the game.

## GSAP

This game uses GSAP for its animations. You can use the free version of GSAP for some commercial projects. However please check the licensing options from [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/licensing/).
